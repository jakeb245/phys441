    "Beginning with the bikeshare_final.ipynb notebook in the Week7and8 folder, create a bikeshare system that models THREE locations (rather than just two).  Assuming the locations are called A, B, and C, use the following parameters:  total number of bikes = 100, p_AB = 0.3, p_BA=0.2, p_AC = 0.4, p_CA=0.1, p_BC=0.35, p_CB=0.15.  Try to determine the optimum initial configuration of the 100 bikes between the three locations such that the number of unsatisfied customers will be minimized over a three-hour period of bike sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a suggestion, try some configurations in steps of 10 bikes for the initial configuration, for example, try A = 10, B = 30, C = 60, and compare that to A = 10, B = 60, C = 30.  This may help you understand where the optimum configuration might be located in the (A,B,C) space.\n"
